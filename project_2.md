# project 2
In this project, our objective is to develop an order execution strategy and to conduct trading simulation using the provided data. The project is divided into three parts, which are to be completed step by step, making it easier for the candidates to achieve the goal.

The provided file TradeTaskLog.csv contains the selected execution tasks, with each line representing a 5-minute task. It also provides information of each task,  including the date and time the task begins, the contract to be traded, the direction of the trading task ( buy or sell ), the volume be traded, and the trading volume in the market during the task period. The level-2 data corresponding to each execution task would be provided. Researchers can use either Python or C/C++ to complete the data analysis and subsequent simulation.
