## project 1: A price prediction signal for stock index futures on China Financial Futures Exchange
Descriptions of the price prediction signal are in project_1.md, along with the research process. Back-testing is based on level-2 data of 3 underlyings (IH, IF, IC) from 2021 to 2023. Assume that we only trade main contracts of IH, IF and IC. There are sample data for the main contracts of IC, IH, and IF in directory “sample_snapshot_data/”.

## project 2: A quant research project for beginner researchers
Consider an order execution problem for 5-minute order execution tasks in commodity futures market (or financial futures market). The researchers will be given level-2 data of traded underlyings (similar to files in directory “sample_snapshot_data/”) , along with the file "TradeTaskLog.csv" that contains the selected historical execution tasks (or randomly generated tasks). Details of the proposed project is in project_2.md
